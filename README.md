# Springboard's Data Science Career Program

Here is the folder structure for all my projects, assignments, and course materials for Springboard's course. The Capstone folder will hold the more advanced projects. 

# Capstone 1

This project was a guided project that showed us the power of machine learning and data analytics. 

# Capstone 2

This is my first solo capstone project - Predicting Star Baker for the Great British Bake Off. 
Each season, 12 contestants compete to impress judges during a variety of baking challenges. From showstopper recipes, to technical scores, to receiving handshakes from the judges; can we predict who will win the weekly coveted prize of Star Baker? This project explores this question and helps reveal insights into what bakers can do to better their chances of winning the award and eventually the show.
